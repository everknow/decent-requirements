Decent-Requirements
-------------------

### Overview
_Decent_ operates as a digital cooperative ("the cooperative") of creators, developers, entrepreneurs and organisations ("the partners") with a primary focus on the development of a Web3 media ecosystem that is delivered via sustainable, scalable, interoperable and composable protocols that are publicly owned, operated and accessible.

Decent's mission is to empower a gobal network of creators to deliver high-quality, innovative and alternative storytelling that challenges the status quo. ("the mission").
Partners are funded directly via commissions ("the commissions") from the cooperative's _Web3 Media Fund_ ("the fund"). 
The fund is initially drawn from public goods focused chain treasuries such as Edgeware to ensure ownership remains globally distributed from the start. 
Partners return value to the fund in the form of attributed NFTs - assets, licenses, rights, contracts and resources ("contributions"). 

Contributions form the foundation of the fund's underlying value ("the reserve").

The present document contains a comprehensive set of requirements prioritised via the MoSCoW approach.
The idea is to keep the requirements in the present form on Github, so that every change is historically traceable.
